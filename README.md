# tag-list

## Purpose

This Meteor package can be used to create a Bootstrap 3 compatible dynamic list or "tag cloud" inside a form, allowing user to add and remove list items easily.

In constrast to alternative JQuery implementations, this packages uses Meteor's reactivity to keep the list updated, and the current list is stored inside a session variable so that it will survive hot code pushes while the user is filling out the form.

Compatibility with Twitter's Typeahead is provided via the sergeyt/meteor-typeahead package.

## Demo and Guide

A demonstration and guide can be found on the project's [Meteor Page](http://tag-list.meteor.com/)
